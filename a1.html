<p>Police in <em>Paris</em> pepper sprayed young protesters near the Sorbonne University as two motions of no confidence were tabled against French President Emmanuel Macron.

One motion of no confidence came from Marine Le Pen's party Rassemblement National and was signed by 88 cross-party MPs.
</p>
<p>
Another group of independent politicians put forward a second motion which was signed by 91 MPs from five parliamentary groups.
</p>
<p>
The political developments come as increasingly tense <em>protests</em> swept through France today.
</p>
<p>
Thousands of people have taken to the streets in a second day of nationwide demonstrations against Macron's decision to force a bill through parliament to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 without a vote.
